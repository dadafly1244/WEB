  <p style="margin-top:40px;">I was with my friends<br>
    We missed the last train<br>
    Ran into your friends<br>
    And they pretended<br>
    Like nothing had changed<br>
    Like everything's alright<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">I shoulda texted<br>
    Before I called you<br>
    I sent you a message<br>
    Maybe you missed it<br>
    Or it never went through<br>
    But it's been one of those nights<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this<br>
    Maybe it's foolish but<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">I don't wanna talk about us<br>
    I just wanna talk about how you been lately<br>
    I don't wanna get my hopes up<br>
    Thinking that we'll ever be together someday<br>
    I don't need anything from you<br>
    And I know it's a little too soon<br>
    But you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I in love once<br>
    And I just wanna see you<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">Nobody said this<br>
    Would ever be easy<br>
    The way that we left it<br>
    Would have such an influence on me<br>
    Wish I could turn back time<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this<br>
    Maybe it's foolish, but<br>
    I don't wanna talk about us<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">I just wanna talk about how you been lately<br>
    I don't wanna get my hopes up<br>
    Thinking that we'll ever be together someday<br>
    I don't need anything from you<br>
    And I know it's a little too soon<br>
    But you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I in love once<br>
    And I just wanna see you<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">I just wanna see you (darlin' I, I just wanna see you)<br>
    Baby, I, yeah I just wanna see you<br>
    Yeah, I just wanna see you<br>
    Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this<br>
    Maybe it's foolish, but<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">I don't wanna talk about us<br>
    I just wanna talk about how you been lately (I do)<br>
    I don't wanna get my hopes up<br>
    Thinking that we'll ever be together someday<br>
    I don't need anything from you<br>
    And I know it's a little too soon<br>
    But you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I in love once<br>
    And I just wanna see you<br>
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">I just wanna see you<br>
    I just wanna see you<br>
